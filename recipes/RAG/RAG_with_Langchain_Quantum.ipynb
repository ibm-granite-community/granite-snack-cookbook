    "## Quantum computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your traditional computer can stream movies and run numerous applications simultaneously, yet it cannot factor large numbers before our sun burns out. However, [quantum computers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/quantum-computing) might do it while you're waiting for your pizza delivery. They outperform the best algorithms on traditional computers, tackling tasks that once seemed impossible. Many of these problems remained out of reach due to the sheer difficulty in terms of time and energy constraints for traditional computers. You might ask, \"Why is this the case? Aren't traditional computers quite powerful in today's world?\" To answer that, yes, they are powerful, but some problems require far greater computational power. For example, imagine being stuck in a maze and you need to find the exit. A traditional computer maps each path step-by-step until it finds the exit. Depending on the maze’s size and the number of paths, finding the exit could take a long time. Quantum computing, however, explores all pathways simultaneously to find the exit. This ability, in turn, removes the constraints that traditional computing faces when dealing with complex problems."

    "## Tutorial overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contains step-by-step instructions for creating a RAG pipeline with [LangChain](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langchain) over text data, specifically an IBM Quantum research paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is an architectural pattern that can be used to augment the performance of [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models). It does this by recalling factual information from an external knowledge base that is then used to inform and enhance the model's generated response. This method is typically more cost-effective and resource-efficient than [fine-tuning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning) a model for specific queries. It is also possible to integrate [autonomous agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents), automated components that can perform retrieval or decision-making tasks, into your RAG system for expanded retrieval capabilities. However, in this walkthrough, we focus on the most common approach to simple RAG by creating dense, numerical [vector](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vector-database) representations of the knowledge base. These representations enable the retrieval of text chunks that are semantically similar to a specific user query. Alternatively, [LangGraph](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/langgraph), the graph-based knowledge retrieval system created by LangChain, can also be used in this process. However, for simplicity and focus, we will be using LangChain, a popular [framework](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-frameworks) for building language model applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases for RAG applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer service chatbot: Answering questions about a product or service by using facts from the product documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain knowledge: Exploring a specialized domain (for example, finance) by using relevant information from papers or articles in the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM-powered news chat: Chatting about current events by calling up relevant recent news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Index knowledge-based passages for efficient retrieval. In this recipe, we take [embeddings](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embedding) of the passages, and store them in a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Retrieve relevant passages from the database by using semantic search. In this recipe, we use an embedding of the query to retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate a response by feeding the retrieved passage to an LLM along with the user query."

    "You have now successfully built a powerful RAG system that combines PDF parsing with semantic search and language generation. This setup has given you a solid foundation for extracting and querying information from complex documents while preserving their structure and context. To take this further, try testing the notebook with different types of PDFs such as technical manuals, research papers, or financial reports to see how it handles various document structures. Also, try experimenting with different models and tweaking their parameters to find the most efficient configuration. You might also consider integrating LangSmith to track retrieval quality and optimize your setup’s performance over time."
