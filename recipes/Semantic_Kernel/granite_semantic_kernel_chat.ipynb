    "# Microsoft Semantic Kernel With IBM Granite 3.3 LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Important Note**: This notebook is **not compatible with Google Colab** as it requires a local Ollama installation running a Granite model. Please run this notebook in a local environment with Ollama properly configured and running on port 11434.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Microsoft Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Microsoft Semantic Kernel (SK)** is an open-source SDK that allows developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications through a unified framework. It acts as a middleware layer that orchestrates AI models, plugins, and traditional programming logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features & Differentiators\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔌 **Plugin Architecture**\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**: Uses a sophisticated plugin system where AI functions can be chained together with traditional code\n",
    "- **Other Frameworks**: Often focus on single model interactions or require custom integration work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **AI Orchestration** \n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**: Built-in planning capabilities that can automatically sequence multiple AI operations\n",
    "- **LangChain/LlamaIndex**: Primarily focused on chaining operations manually\n",
    "- **OpenAI API**: Direct model access without orchestration features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **Multi-Model Support**\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**: Vendor-agnostic - works with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama, and more\n",
    "- **Other Frameworks**: Often tied to specific providers or require extensive configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Enterprise-Ready**\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**: Built with enterprise needs in mind - security, scalability, and integration with Microsoft ecosystem\n",
    "- **Other Frameworks**: May require additional tooling for enterprise deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Granite 3.3\n",
    "\n",
    "**IBM Granite 3.3** models feature enhanced reasoning capabilities and support for Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion. Key highlights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Architecture**: New dense architecture trained with 12 trillion tokens across 12 languages and 116 programming languages\n",
    "- **128K Context Length**: Extended context for complex tasks\n",
    "- **Strong RAG Performance**: Excellent retrieval-augmented generation capabilities\n",
    "- **Function Calling**: Native support for tool/function calling\n",
    "- **Response Controls**: Built-in length and originality controls\n",
    "- **Apache 2.0 License**: Fully open-source\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ollama installed locally**: Download and install from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)\n",
    "2. **Granite 3.3 8B model downloaded**: Run `ollama pull granite3.3:8b` in your terminal\n",
    "3. **Ollama running**: Start Ollama service (usually `ollama serve` or it starts automatically)\n",
    "4. **Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12**: This notebook requires a recent Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simple chatbot using Semantic Kernel with:\n",
    "- **Ollama** as the local AI provider\n",
    "- **Granite 3.3 8B** model for responses  \n",
    "- **Granite 3.3 prompt template** following official guidelines\n",
    "- **Async execution** for responsive interactions"
