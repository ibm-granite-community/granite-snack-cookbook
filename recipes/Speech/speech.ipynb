    "\n",
    "The core of our assistant will be powered by two main components:\n",
    "1.  **Granite Speech 3.3 8B**: To accurately transcribe spoken audio from the microphone into text in real-time.\n",
    "2.  **Granite Instruct 3.3 8B**: A large language model (LLM) that will understand the transcribed text and generate intelligent, conversational responses.\n",

    "With our sample audio file ready, we can now use the Granite Speech model to convert it to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "The process involves two helper functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `encode_audio(filepath)`: The Replicate API expects the audio data to be sent as a base64-encoded [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs). This function reads our `.wav` file, encodes it, and formats it into the required string format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  `transcribe(data_uri)`: This is the core function for speech-to-text. It uses the `langchain-community` integration to call the `ibm-granite/granite-speech-3.3-8b` model on Replicate. We pass the encoded audio and a simple prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call these functions and print the transcription of our sample file."
