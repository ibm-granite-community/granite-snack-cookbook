    "# Use LM Studio to build automatic tool calling with Granite\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step-by-step tutorial, you will use LM Studio with the open source IBM® [Granite® 3.3-8b instruct model](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct-GGUF) on your local machine. Initially, you will test the local model as is and then write Python functions the model can use for automatic tool calling. Finally, you will develop more functions to play a game of chess with an [AI agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents). This tutorial can also be found in the IBM Granite Community's [Granite Snack Cookbook GitHub](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-snack-cookbook/blob/main/recipes/Tool-Calling/Automatic_Tool_Calling.ipynb) in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LM Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "LM Studio is an application for working with local [large language models](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models) (LLMs). You can use any [open source model](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/open-source-llms) with LM Studio, such as [Mistral AI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/mistral-ai) models, [Google’s Gemma](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/google-gemma), Meta’s Llama or [DeepSeek’s R1](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deepseek) series. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using LM Studio, beginner to more advanced users can run LLMs with either their computer’s CPU or even a [GPU](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpu). LM Studio offers a chat-like interface to interact with local LLMs similar to [ChatGPT](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatgpt)'s chat. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a local AI model, you can [fine-tune](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/fine-tuning), [inference](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-inference) and more without having to worry about external [API](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/api) calls (like OpenAI or IBM watsonx.ai application programming interfaces, or APIs) or token usage. LM Studio also lets users locally and privately “chat with documents.” A user can attach a document to a chat session and ask questions about the document. In cases where the document is long, LM Studio will set up a [retrieval augmented generation](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/retrieval-augmented-generation) (RAG) system for querying."

    "## Tool calling\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs excel at understanding and generating human-like text, they often face limitations when tasks require precise computation, access to real-time external data or the execution of specific, well-defined procedures. By implementing [tool calling](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/tool-calling), we equip LLMs with a set of \"tools\" —external functions— that they can choose to call that can significantly extend their capabilities. This tutorial will demonstrate how to define these tools and integrate them, enabling the LLM to perform a wider range of tasks with greater reliability."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how integrating tools can enhance the utility and agentic capability of LLMs. We illustrated that by providing an LLM with access to predefined external functions, it can transcend its core language processing capabilities to perform tasks like accurate calculations or interface with external systems. It cannot do this reliably on its own. The key takeaway is that tool-use empowers LLMs to delegate specific sub-problems to specialized routines, allowing them to ground their responses in factual data or precise operations. This approach not only improves accuracy but also enables LLMs to engage in more complex, interactive workflows, effectively transforming them into more versatile and powerful assistants."
