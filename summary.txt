Here is a summary of the summarized text:

The text is a philosophical and social critique by Henry David Thoreau, criticizing society's emphasis on material possessions, financial security, and external appearances over personal growth, self-actualization, and inner freedom. Thoreau argues that many people are trapped in cycles of poverty, debt, and drudgery, living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends meet. He also critiques the institution of slavery, both literal and figurative, suggesting that people can be enslaved by their own negative thoughts and behaviors. Throughout the passage, Thoreau uses metaphors, rhetorical questions, and vivid imagery to encourage readers to reflect on their values and priorities in order to live more authentic and meaningful lives.
